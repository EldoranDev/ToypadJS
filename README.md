# ToypadJS

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a very WIP implementation and definetly not production ready

TypeScript implementation of the Lego ToyPad (originaly created for Lego Dimensions) directly to use in the browser

> [!WARNING]
> The package requires the Toypad to be detected as a Human Interface Device (HID). In the WinUSB driver is installd through zadig this is not the case
> and the default HID-Driver needs to be selected for the Toypad to be detected by the browser.
